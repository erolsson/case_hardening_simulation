** This is how comments are written

** Name of the simulation, all abaqus simulations will be named
** Toolbox_Carbon_name, Toolbox_Thermal_name etc.
*simulation_name, name=example

** The abaqus input file containing all nodes, elements and sets needed for heat treatment simulations
*model_file, filename=~/case_hardening_simulation/heat_sim_example/model_files/simple_geometry.inp

** A file defining the boundary conditions using abaqus input syntax for
** the mechanical part of the heat treatment simulations
*bc_file, filename=~/case_hardening_simulation/heat_sim_example/model_files/bc_simple_geometry.inc

** Directory where the simulation will be done, should preferably be on a local disc
*simulation_directory, directory=~/heat_simulation_test/simulation_1/

** Directory where the odb files are moved after the simulation, if omitted, the simulation
**   files stays in simulation_directory
*odb_directory, directory=~/heat_simulation_test/results/

** Name of the Dante material, a list of available materials can be found by
** 	case_hardening_simulation -l dante_materials [optionals: config_file, dante_material_path]
*material, dante_material_name=U92506

** A table with two columns  with heat treatment data on the form:
**   time point (minutes), carbon potential (%wt)
** The first time point has to be zero and thus sets the initial conditions
*carbon_potential, boundary_condition=mass_transfer
	0,	   0.6
	120.,  0.6
	121.,  1.2
	300.,  1.2
	301.,  0.7
	436.,  0.7

** A table with two columns  with heat treatment data on the form:
**   time point (minutes), carburization temperature (%wt)
** The first time point has to be zero and thus sets the initial conditions
*carburization_temperature
    0.,      20.
    60.,     940.
    345.,    940.
    346.,    850.
    436.,    850.

** A table with four columns defining the cooling process:
**   step name, time (minutes), temperature (C) and the
** name of the interaction property controlling the heat transfer to the component
** A list of implemented cooling media can be found by running
**   case_hardening_simulation -l interaction_property
*Cooling
	Transfer,	1.,	    840.,   	HOT_AIR
	Quenching,	10.,	120.,	    QUENCHWAY_125B_Used_0mps
	Cooldown,	60.,	70.,	    COOL_AIR

** A table with four columns defining the tempering data:
**   step_name, time (minutes), temperature (C), and the interaction_property
*Tempering
	tempering, 120,	    180.,       COOL_AIR

*final_temperature, temperature=20.
