** This file contains material data for carbon transfer used in the carbon transfer subroutine
** The model used calculates the flux as beta*(carbon_pot - surface_carbon)
** where beta is a surface carbon and temperature dependent coefficient according to
**      beta = a1 + a2*temperature + (b1 + b2*temperature)*surface_carbon
** and the parameters below is given as
**      a1, a2, b1, b2
** The data is taken from
**  "Calculation of Gas Carburizing Kinetics  from Carbon Concentration Profiles based on Direct Flux Integration"
